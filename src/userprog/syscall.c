      int wait (pid_t pid)
      Waits for a child process pid and retrieves the child’s exit status.
      If pid is still alive, waits until it terminates. Then, returns the status that pid passed
      to exit. If pid did not call exit(), but was terminated by the kernel (e.g. killed due
      to an exception), wait(pid) must return -1. It is perfectly legal for a parent process
      to wait for child processes that have already terminated by the time the parent calls
      wait, but the kernel must still allow the parent to retrieve its child’s exit status, or
      learn that the child was terminated by the kernel.
      wait must fail and return -1 immediately if any of the following conditions is true:
          
          • pid does not refer to a direct child of the calling process. pid is a direct child
          of the calling process if and only if the calling process received pid as a return
          value from a successful call to exec.
          Note that children are not inherited: if A spawns child B and B spawns child
          process C, then A cannot wait for C, even if B is dead. A call to wait(C) by
          process A must fail. Similarly, orphaned processes are not assigned to a new
          parent if their parent process exits before they do.

          • The process that calls wait has already called wait on pid. That is, a process
          may wait for any given child at most once.
          
      Processes may spawn any number of children, wait for them in any order, and may
      even exit without having waited for some or all of their children. Your design should
      consider all the ways in which waits can occur. All of a process’s resources, including
      its struct thread, must be freed whether its parent ever waits for it or not, and
      regardless of whether the child exits before or after its parent.
      You must ensure that Pintos does not terminate until the initial process exits.
      The supplied Pintos code tries to do this by calling process_wait() (in
      ‘userprog/process.c’) from main() (in ‘threads/init.c’). We suggest that you
      implement process_wait() according to the comment at the top of the function
      and then implement the wait system call in terms of process_wait().
      Implementing this system call requires considerably more work than any of the rest.

Pintos Project 3: Virtual Memory
There are several groups of tests for the required functionality: dynamic paging/lazy loading, stack growth, memory-mapped files, extra synchronization for user memory access. There are 34 new functionality tests and 79 regression tests. The regression tests are the same as in Project 2. Each test passed is worth 10 points. Note that you need a working Project 2, at the very least working argument passing and system calls, to work on Project 3.
